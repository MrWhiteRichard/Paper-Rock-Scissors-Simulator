# Paper-Rock-Scissors-Simulator

A dynamic simulator that brings the classic game of Paper-Rock-Scissors to life—inside a box full of bouncing balls!

In this simulation, balls of three types—**Paper**, **Rock**, and **Scissors**—move within a confined 2D space. Each ball has a position and velocity, and when two balls collide, they "play" a game of PRS:
- The **loser** transforms into the **type of the winner**.
- If a ball hits a wall, it simply bounces—no PRS played.

This project explores emergent dynamics and type dominance through simple yet engaging rules. Great for visual simulations, game theory experiments, or just for fun.
